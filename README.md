# BERD Winter Institute for Biostatistics
This is the code used for a research project during the Winter Institute in Biostatistics at the University at Buffalo. The project looked
at data from a prospective cohort study of adults between the ages of 40 and 80 years. Baseline characteristics (systolic blood pressure,
HDL-cholesterol concentration, etc.) were obtained and then the participants were followed up with to determine if there was incidence of
myocardial infarction (MI).

The purpose of the study was to determine which of the variables that data was collected on, if any, affect the probability of the 
incidence of MI.
